            Hi, my name is Michael. I'm a Front-end Software Engineer and Oil
            Painter.

            I like creating good looking and elegant front ends. I'm currently
            learning Typescript and the functional programming paradigm within
            Javascript.

            When I'm not learning one of the above or wrestling with webpack I'm
            usually in the studio painting or on Codewars.
